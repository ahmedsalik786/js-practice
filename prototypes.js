//What are object prototypes?
//All javascript objects inherit properties from a prototype. For example,

// * Date objects inherit properties from the Date prototype
//*Math objects inherit properties from the Math prototype
// *Array objects inherit properties from the Array prototype.
// *On top of the chain is Object.prototype. Every prototype inherits properties and methods from the Object.prototype.
// *A prototype is a blueprint of an object. The prototype allows us to use properties and methods on an object even if the properties and methods do not exist on the current object.
